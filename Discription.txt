The program reads a URL link from the console.
Displays a space-separated list of all options (Parameters come after ? and are separated by &, eg lvl=15).
The URL contains at least 1 parameter.
Parameters should be displayed in the same order as they are presented in the URL.
If the obj parameter is present, it will pass its value to the desired alert() method:
alert(double value) - for numbers (don't forget that the number can be fractional);
alert(String value) - for strings.
